# Bug Diagnosis
Issue: Backward compatability check for hasAccessibilityProperties in Firefox 61 no longer required. 
Benefit: The clearing of redundant code makes it easier to read, and prevents confusion in the future. 

# Solution
Remove the hasMethod check and consequential if statement (lines 953-961)

# Testing
As this is the removal of redundant code, no special tests were done. 
However, the following steps were taken to verify that nothing broke nonetheless after removing the aforementioned lines;
1. Verify the lines have, in fact, been removed
2. Run ```./mach build``` to verify that Mozilla builds without errors 
3. Run ```./mach test``` to make sure all automated tests pass
